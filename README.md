## Installing the Roboto Font

* Download Roboto from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto
* On OsX install using FontBook, On Linux???
* You may need to update the font-cache, it worked for me without this, but see https://scentellegher.github.io/visualization/2018/05/02/custom-fonts-matplotlib.html
* Remove the matplotlib cache dir, For me this was `~/.matplotlib`
* Restart Jupyter
